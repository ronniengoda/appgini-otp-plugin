# appgini-otp-plugin
This plugin will enable you activate two step verification using email OTP in your Appgini application. Once activated, all users who attempt to login to your application will be sent an OTP to their registered email for verification. This happens all the time a user logs in. To use this plugin you must use SMTP as your mail sending method.
